# Introduction

> “Enterprise Medical Log, Stardate 5327.4. Dr. Leonard McCoy recording. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock were rescued 48 hours ago, along with several deceased members of the away team. They do not know why the creature ignored them during the attack, but I have my suspicions. The victims were all wearing red shirts.”---@mccoy5327

I am haunted by an uncomfortable reality: Over the past several weeks the number of deaths I have listed on the *Enterprise*^[The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), a Constitution-class starship launched by Starfleet in the year 2245.] is growing, and no matter the circumstance they all share one thing in common—each and every one of them wore a red uniform. I approached First Officer Spock with my concerns, but he brushed me off as thinking with undue emotions. Our operations division wears red uniforms, so this pattern of deaths was “logical" [@spock2287].

Despite that damn Vulcan’s logic, he could not explain why himself and Captain Kirk had not yet suffered similar fates. I can find no reason why they are still alive, except, possibly, that the colour of their uniforms is somehow involved. Although improbable, it is the only hypothesis I have. Captain Kirk has employed Spock and I to conduct a study to investigate.

The aim of our study is simple: We will test whether the uniform colour of Starfleet officers on board the Enterprise cause them to suffer more severe injuries during away missions. I hypothesize that, regardless of their division, officers wearing red uniforms will suffer more severe injuries. Spock states that this is illogical, and hypothesizes that members of the operations division will continue to suffer more severe injuries no matter their uniform colour.

# Methodology

```{r study-1-data}
# Load study data for analysis
redshirts <- read_csv(here("Data", "redshirts.csv"))
```

## Participants

```{r participants}
# Get participant demographics for printing -----------------------------------
demographics <- redshirts %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            age_mean = glue("$\\mathit{{M_{{age}}}} = {print_num(mean(age))}$"),
            age_sd = glue("$\\mathit{{SD_{{age}}}} = {print_num(sd(age))}$")
            ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from = n:age_sd)

# Get the number of excluded participants for printing ------------------------
# I'm just using this code to demonstrate printing numbers in the body as
# English words. If you actually wanted to exclude participants you'd want to
# filter them out of your dataset and calculate the total excluded from there.
exclusions <- str_to_title(english(6)) # for lowercase wrap in as.character()
```

`r nrow(redshirts)` Starfleet officers on board the starship Enterprise participated in our study, `r demographics$n_man` of which identified as men (`r demographics$age_mean_man`, `r demographics$age_sd_man`) and `r demographics$n_woman` as women (`r demographics$age_mean_woman`, `r demographics$age_sd_woman`). Myself, First Officer Spock, and Captain Kirk did not participate in the study. `r exclusions` redshirts who were supposed to participate were excluded from the study. A can be seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:rip-redshirts), Captain Kirk foolishly sent them on an away mission; we have lost all contact since.

## Design

We used a 3x3 independent design to test our hypotheses, with division (science/medical, command, operations) and uniform colour (blue, yellow, red) as independent variables. The Starfleet designations for divisions and their uniform colours can be seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:starfleet-divisions). Severity of injury---our dependent variable---was measured on a 10-point scale developed by @phlox2153, where one represented the lowest severity and ten the highest. Examples of lower severity injuries include broken bones, cellular damage, or curable infections obtained during copulation with an alien species. Higher severity injuries include decapitation by Bat'leth, exposure to delta-particle radiation, or being crushed by Tribbles.

## Procedure

Our procedure was simple, although imperfect as First Officer Spock wants us to remind you. Each Starfleet officer was randomly assigned a uniform colour they were to wear over a one month period, however, they remained within their current division due to operational constraints. Aside from this, each officer continued with their regular duties aboard the Enterprise. My medical team and I then recorded the severity of injury, division, and uniform colour for any patients that came into sickbay during the study period. Patients with multiple visits had their severity of injury scores averaged at the end of the period so their was only one score per participant.

# Results

## Two-way ANOVA assumptions

```{r assumptions}
# Get skewness, kurtosis and Shapiro-Wilk (normality) -------------------------
# - Skewness should be in the range of +/- 2
# - Kurtosis should be in the range of +/- 7
# - Significance indicates the assumption is violated
assumption_normality <-
  test_normality(redshirts,
                 dv = injury_severity,
                 group_by = c(division, uniform_colour)) %>%
  # Prepare table for printing
  mutate(cell = str_to_title(str_replace_all(cell, "_", " "))) %>%
  mutate(across(skewness:statistic, print_num)) %>%
  mutate(p.value = print_p(p.value, in_table = TRUE)) %>%
  rename("**Cell**" = cell,
         "**Skewness**" = skewness,
         "**Kurtosis**" = kurtosis,
         "***W***" = statistic,
         "***df***" = df,
         "***p***" = p.value)

# Run Levene's test on DV (homogeneity of variance) ---------------------------
# - Significance indicates the assumption is violated
assumption_variance <-
  car::leveneTest(injury_severity ~ division*uniform_colour,
                  data = redshirts,
                  center = mean) %>%
  # Prepare for printing
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(statistic = print_num(statistic)) %>%
  mutate(p.value = print_p(p.value)) %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$F({df}, {df.residual}) = {statistic}$, $p {p.value}$"))
```

Our data met two of the assumptions for an independent two-way ANOVA. Specifically, injury severity was measured on an interval scale, and all observations for injury severity were independent. Two assumptions were not met. Shapiro-Wilk’s test of normality showed that the distribution of injury severity within each of the experiment cells was significantly different from a normal distribution (see Table\ \@ref(tab:normality-table)); and Levene’s test showed that the variances for injury severity between each of the experiment cells were not equal, `r assumption_variance$print`. However, as discussed in @mudd2266, meeting these assumptions is unnecessary for our analyses due to statistical advances in the late 21st century. Because of this, we continued with our analysis as planned.

```

```{r two-way-anova}
# Run the two-way ANOVA with Type II sums of squares to test main effects -----
model <- aov(injury_severity ~ division*uniform_colour, data = redshirts)

# Get the two-way ANOVA table for statistical significance interpretation

# Get effect sizes for practical significance interpretation
effsize <- effectsize::omega_squared(model) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(term = Parameter, omegasq.partial = Omega2_partial)

# Prepare model for printing --------------------------------------------------
model_list <- model_summary %>%
  left_join(effsize) %>%
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, ":", "_x_")) %>%
  mutate(df.residual = pull(filter(model_summary, term == "Residuals"), df),
         .after = df) %>%
  mutate(across(sumsq:statistic, print_num)) %>%
  mutate(across(c(p.value, omegasq.partial), print_p)) %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$F({df}, {df.residual}) = {statistic}$, ",
                      "$p {p.value}$, ",
                      "$\\omega^2_p {omegasq.partial}$")) %>%
  split(.$term)
```
